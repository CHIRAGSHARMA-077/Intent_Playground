##  What I Learned
While working on this app, I learned the core concepts of **Intents in Android**, both:
- **Explicit Intents** – Used for navigating between different screens within the app.
- **Implicit Intents** – Used for performing actions like opening a website, sharing text, picking an image, or viewing app info using system apps or other installed apps.

I also became familiar with:
- The basic structure of an Android project.
- XML layouts and how to design simple user interfaces.
- Using `LinearLayout` and managing UI components like buttons.
- Managing `AndroidManifest.xml` for declaring activities and intent filters.
- How different lifecycle methods and intent handlers work behind the scenes.

## What I Applied
In the project, I successfully implemented:
- **Multiple buttons** in the main screen, each triggering a different type of intent.
- A second activity screen using explicit intent.
- Opening a browser with a URL using an implicit intent.
- Sharing plain text to other apps like WhatsApp or Notes.
- Picking an image from the device gallery.
- Viewing app details from system settings.

I also explored Android Studio tools like the **design preview**, **component tree**, and **device emulators**.

##  Challenges I Faced
This project didn’t go smoothly at first. Some of the challenges included:
- Getting a **mysterious XML rendering error** that turned out to be caused by a hidden or corrupted background image file.
- Difficulty finding “Build > Clean Project” and other rebuild options in Android Studio’s updated UI.
- Layout preview not rendering properly even though the code was correct.
- Minor bugs like mistyped tags (e.g., `utton` instead of `Button`) that caused layout crashes.
- Confusion with handling permissions and image picker intent.

These issues were frustrating, especially when I couldn't immediately figure out the cause — but working through them taught me a **lot about debugging Android apps**.

##  Final Outcome
After working through all the issues, I finally got the app running smoothly. Each button now performs the intended action correctly, and the UI behaves well on different screen sizes. It may be a small project, but for me, it was a big step forward in learning **real-world Android development**.
